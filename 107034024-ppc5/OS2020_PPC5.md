Note: The last instruction of testpaking.hex without adding any human-readable text is at 0x6D6 of the code memory, so these static output chars can be stored at 0x700 to 0x730 of the code memory (it should not affect any parts of this program).

### 1. delay(n) and now()

The description below is derived from the given PPC5:

```c
void delay(unsigned char n) -->  delays the thread by *n* time units
unsigned char now(void) --> returns the “current time”
(i.e., number of time units that has elapsed since the system reboots).
Note that any time unit that is larger than 1 second is not useful.
```

Two new global variables and one global array are added:

```c
__data __at (0x2E) unsigned char count;
__data __at (0x2F) unsigned char time;
__data __at (0x39) unsigned char delayID[MAXTHREADS];
```
Every time when **void mytime0handler(void)** is called, **count** will be increased by 1. Every four times **void mytime0handler(void)** is called (i.e. count == 4), **time** will be increased by 1 and **count** will be reset to 0. The **unsigned char time** act like a time unit, wheras **unsigned char count** act like a 1/4 time unit.

Also, there are only four threads in this project, so there are at most four delay() being called simultaneously. So I set up an array **unsigned char delayID[MAXTHREADS]** and it is used to track when **delay()** of each thread should exit.

```c
void myTimer0Handler(){
	/***** SAVESTATE *****/
  /*** SWITCH THREAD ***/
	count ++;
	if(count == 4){
		count = 0;
		time ++;
	}
	/***** RESTORESTATE *****/
}

// delay(n) function, where n is the number of time units to delay. 
void delay(unsigned char n) {
    delayID[curThread] = time + n;
    while(time != delayID[curThread]);
    delayID[curThread] = 0;
}

unsigned char now(void){
		return time;
}
```

> Note:
>
> An important consideration is that delay() is not an exact delay but is a delay for “at least *n* time units” and “less than (*n* + 0.5) time units” for it to be acceptable (otherwise, it rounds up to *n*+1 time units, which would not be correct). Of course, the more accurate the better, but there is an inherent limit on how accurate it can be. 

In the case when all delay() finish at the same time, we will need to let all threads finish delay() **at the same time unit** and the length of a time unit has to be **at least four interrupts** to include the worst - case completion time to be less than (n+1).

Thus, I choose the time unit based on interrupt interval of switching threads and note that it is not the actual time unit (e.g., number of seconds, ms, µs). As stated above, the **unsigned char time** act like a time unit while **unsigned char count** act like a 1/4 time unit, which means that the length of one time unit in this project is the same as four interruot intervals of timer-0. Also, in the **void delay(unsigned char n)** function above, it will delay for at least **n** time units and less than **(n+1)** time units, even though the checkpoint description said that it should be “at least *n* time units” and “less than (*n* + 0.5) time units. To implement it with (n + 0.5) time units, just simply set **count** as **1/8** time units and make **time** increase every **8** interrupts, the reason is that we do nothing when **count** is between **5** and **8**, which makes delay(n) bounds to “at least *n* time units” and “less than (*n* + 0.5) time units”, however, this is less effcient, so I choose 4-interrupts version instead.

As you can see, the function **unsigned char now(void)** implemented above just simply return the **time** variable.

### 2. Robust Thread Termination and Creation

> You should implement the thread termination so that a thread can safely terminate by either calling ThreadExit() or return normally from the function. 
>
> This is easy, because all you have to do is to push the return address of ThreadExit() on the stack. ThreadExit() just has to mark the thread as unallocated.
> One other thing you need to do is to guard thread creation and termination. We have a maximum limit of 4 threads. 
>
> This means you need to use a semaphore to allow creation of threads up to the max, and any attempt to create additional threads will block until some thread has exited. Add the proper code in your ThreadCreate() and ThreadExit() code to make use of the semaphore(s) similar to the bounded-buffer example.
> One thing about ThreadExit() is that if you are the last thread to exit, then it should enter an infinite loop, instead of returning to nowhere.



Since there is only four threads in this project, but there are five cars to compete, so we need to implement **ThreadExit** in this checkpoint.

```c
/*
 * ThreadExit() is called by the thread's own code to termiate
 * itself.  It will never return; instead, it switches context
 * to another thread.
 */
void ThreadExit(void) {
	/*
	 * clear the bit for the current thread from the
	 * bit mask, decrement thread count (if any),
	 * and set current thread to another valid ID.
	 */
	EA = 0;	// disable interrupt when terminating thread
      __asm 
        mov A, #0
        push A 
        push A 
        push A 
        push A
        push A
        push A
        push A
        push A
      __endasm; 
      savedSP[curThread] = 0;					// reset stack pointer
      mask &= ~(1 << curThread);			// update bitmap
      if(mask == 0){									// if it is the last thread
          while(1){};									// then enter infinite loop
      }
      do {			// switch to the next ready thread
          curThread = (curThread == 3) ? 0 : curThread + 1;
          if(mask & isAlive[curThread]) break;
      } while (1);
      RESTORESTATE;
	
	EA = 1;
}
```

Ir is mentioned in the checkpoint that a semaphore to allow creation of threads up to the max is needed, and any attempt to create additional threads will block until some thread has exited. However, I use another method to make sure that the program will not create the fifth thread when there is already four threads running. I place the code in my **main()** instead of adding semaphores.

```c
void main(void) {
    /***** after initialization *****/

    ThreadCreate(Car1);
    do{ delay(2); } while(bitmap==0x0F);
    ThreadCreate(Car2);
    do{ delay(2); } while(bitmap==0x0F);
    ThreadCreate(Car3);
    do{ delay(2); } while(bitmap==0x0F);
    ThreadCreate(Car4);
    do{ delay(2); } while(bitmap==0x0F);
    ThreadCreate(Car5);

    /***** print the result to UART *****/
}
```

By the line ```do{ delay(2); } while(bitmap==0x0F);``` *main* itself will keep calling ```delay(2)``` whenever the number of threads is full. Hence, we ensure the maximum limit of four threads running in this project.  

Finally, *ThreadCreate* function is not modified, it stays the same as in **ppc1**.

```c
/*
 * ThreadCreate() creates a thread data structure so it is ready
 * to be restored (context switched in).
 * The function pointer itself should take no argument and should
 * return no argument.
 * create a thread and then have it run the FunctionPtr fp function
 */
ThreadID ThreadCreate(FunctionPtr fp) {
  /* check to see we have not reached the max #threads.
   * if so, return -1, which is not a valid thread ID.
   */
	if(mask == 0b1111) return -1;	// mask = 15, four thread
	
  /* otherwise, find a thread ID that is not in use,
   * and grab it. (can check the bit mask for threads)
   */
  EA = 0; // disable interrupt when creating thread
		
  	
  		/* a. update the bit mask */
  		/* b. calculate the starting stack location for new thread */
      for(i = 0; i < MAXTHREADS; i++) {
          if(((mask) & (0b0001 << i)) == 0) {
              mask |= (0b0001 << i);
              newThread = i;
              break;
          }
      }

  		/* c. save the current SP in a temporary
						set SP to the starting location for the new thread */
      tmp = SP;
      SP = 0x3F + (i << 4);

  	/* d. push the return address fp (2-byte parameter to
		ThreadCreate) onto stack so it can be the return
		address to resume the thread. Note that in SDCC
		convention, 2-byte ptr is passed in DPTR.  but
		push instruction can only push it as two separate
		registers, DPL and DPH. 
		
		e. we want to initialize the registers to 0, so we
		assign a register to 0 and push it four times
		for ACC, B, DPL, DPH.  Note: push #0 will not work
		because push takes only direct address as its operand,
		but it does not take an immediate (literal) operand.
		*/
      __asm
        push DPL
        push DPH
        mov A, #0
        push A
        push A
        push A
        push A
      __endasm;
  
  /*  f. finally, we need to push PSW (processor status word)
		register, which consist of bits
		CY AC F0 RS1 RS0 OV UD P
		all bits can be initialized to zero, except <RS1:RS0>
		which selects the register bank.  
		Thread 0 uses bank 0, Thread 1 uses bank 1, etc.
		Setting the bits to 00B, 01B, 10B, 11B will select 
		the register bank so no need to push/pop registers
		R0-R7.  So, set PSW to 
		00000000B for thread 0, 00001000B for thread 1,
		00010000B for thread 2, 00011000B for thread 3.
	*/
  
      /*
      00000000B for thread 0, 00001000B for thread 1,
      00010000B for thread 2, 00011000B for thread 3.
      ==> THAT IS TO SHIFT RIGHT 3 BITS
      */
      tmp2 = (i << 3);

      __asm
        push _tmp2
      __endasm;

  /*
  g. write the current stack pointer to the saved stack
		pointer array for this newly created thread ID
	h. set SP to the saved SP in step c.
	i. finally, return the newly created thread ID. */
      savedSP[newThread] = SP;
      SP = tmp;
	EA = 1;
	return newThread;
}
```



### 3. Parking Lot Example

```c
// based on python parking simulation code
__data __at (0x30) Semaphore sem;    		// semaphore for available spot
__data __at (0x31) Semaphore spotsSync;	// for synchronizing access to spots
__data __at (0x32) char spots[2];				// two parking spots available
__data __at (0x25) char mask;
__data __at (0x2F) unsigned char time;

// For UART output
__data __at (0x34) unsigned char CarIn[5];	// the time when each car get a spot
__data __at (0x4A) unsigned char CarOut[5];	// the time when each car exit
__data __at (0x5A) unsigned char CarSpot[5];// the spot each car parks at

/* To display output with human-readable text */
__code __at (0x700) char Car[5] = "Car ";
__code __at (0x710) char GotSpot[10] = " in spot ";
__code __at (0x720) char TimeUnit[12] = " at time : ";
__code __at (0x730) char ExitSpot[5] = " out";

/* testpaking.hex the last instruction is at 0x6D6 of the code memory, so 
	 these static output chars can be stored at 0x700 to 0x730 
   of the code memory (it should not affect any parts of this program) */
```

Then, I create five functions in **testparking.c**, *Car1*, *Car2*, *Car3*, *Car4*, and *Car5*. These functions are almost the same, only differ in the indices of arrays. Thus, I would take *Car1* as example as follows.

> Instead of immediately writing out the result, you should maintain a “log” for the events:
>
> - when a car gets the parking spot (what time, which spot)
> - when a car exits the parking lot (what time)

```c
void Car1(void){
	SemaphoreWait(sem);             // wait for an available spot
	
	EA=0;                           // start parking, should not interrupt
    // ensure only one can work on spot changing at any time
  	SemaphoreWait(spotsSync);			
    if(spots[0]=='X') {         	// decide which spot to park
        spots[0] = '1';
        CarSpot[0] = '0';					// save the parking spot for UART output
    } else {
        spots[1] = '1';
        CarSpot[0] = '1';
    }
    CarIn[0] = now();							// save the parking time for UART output
    SemaphoreSignal(spotsSync);
	EA=1;														// finish parking, enable interrupt

    delay(7);		// delay (parking) for a while

  EA=0;														// start exiting, should not interrupt
    SemaphoreWait(spotsSync);
    if(spots[0]=='1') {						// find which spot it is parking at
        spots[0] = 'X';						// leave the spot, set empty
    } else {
        spots[1] = 'X';
    }
    CarOut[0] = now();						// save the exit time for UART output
    SemaphoreSignal(spotsSync);	
  EA=1;														// finish exiting, enable interrupt
		SemaphoreSignal(sem);					// release sem so another car can park
    ThreadExit();									// externally call ThreadExit()
}
```

Finally, *main()* calls each *Car[1-5]* functions and wait for them to finish.  
As for the UART output, we implement it entirely in the modified *Consumer()* function. There is no *Producer* anymore and it is in fact not doing any Producer-Consumer type of things. Instead, it outputs the result in a brute-force approach through for loops. The following is part of the code:  

```c
void Consumer(void) {
    /***** initialize timer1 for Tx *****/

    for(char i=0; i<5; i++){        // for Car1 to Car5
        
        /***** some UART output *****/

        // output " got spot "
        for(char j=0; j<11; j++) {
            SBUF = GotSpot[j];
            while(!TI);
            TI = 0;
        }

        // output the spot that Car[i+1] parks at
        SBUF = CarSpot[i];
        while(!TI);
        TI = 0;

        // output " at time unit: "
        for(char j=0; j<16; j++) {
            SBUF = TimeUnit[j];
            while(!TI);
            TI = 0;
        }

        /***** some UART output *****/
    }
}
```

#### ScreenShot3

After printing, *main* calls ```ThreadExit()``` and the program enters an infinite loop.

#### ScreenShot4

The human-readable result is presented on the UART. The result is constant since the delay time unit is fixed.
